            <p>My name is Pat! I first developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies one day when I was eating salmon for breakfast. My lazy self used the same plate I had used to eat salmon so my cookies tasted a little fishy, and well, I kind of fell in love with the taste! I knew it didn't sound as appealing as it tasted and people would question this combination so I had to find a way to make the taste more suttle. I found that if the fish is ground up fine enough, you can barely even taste it! </p>

            <p>Fast forward a few months, and my cookies are a hit! I started by selling them to a few friends and co workers, but eventually word got out and I couldn't keep up with the orders. I quit my job and decided to open the Salmon Cookie Shop! Not only do the locals love them, but my cookie shops have become one of the biggest attractions in Seattle! Tourists go gaga for them! </p><br>
